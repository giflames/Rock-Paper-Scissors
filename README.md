# Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors Game!

This repository contains a Python script developed as part of the ASIMOV Academy course. Through this project, I applied the knowledge acquired during the course to create a simple yet engaging game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The game allows players to face off against the computer in a classic showdown, all within the comfort of the terminal.

Features:
- Player vs. Computer gameplay
- Easy-to-understand rules
- Terminal-based interface for seamless interaction
